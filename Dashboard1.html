<h4>Dashboard 1: Number of trees planted and carbon bang per buck</h4>
<p>This dashboard allows the user to input an investment value, a social discount rate, and a carbon discount rate in the cells highlighted yellow. All three dashboards refresh based on these three inputs. It then displays the number of small, medium, large, and conifer trees that can be planted in each region for the chosen level of investment and displays the carbon bang per buck, which is the metric tons of carbon sequestered or avoided per one thousand dollars spent over the forty-year period.
The investment value is how much the user will invest in urban forestry and management projects over the forty-year period. The social discount rate is used to calculate costs and benefits over the forty-year period rather than the interest rate to reflect that investments in urban trees represent investments in urban infrastructure. A social discount rate of 3.5% is typical in benefit-cost analyses like these. </p>
<p>Finally, the user must select a carbon discount rate. Discounting the carbon sequestration or avoidance effects of urban tree planting and maintenance assumes that carbon sequestration and avoidance today is worth more than carbon sequestration tomorrow. Discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% are typical in the U.S., but other models use rates as low as 0.1%. </p>
