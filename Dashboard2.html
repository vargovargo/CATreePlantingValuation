<h4>Dashboard 2: Carbon sequestered or avoided</h4>
<p>The figures in this dashboard display the cumulative metric tons of carbon sequestered or avoided over the forty-year period for each size tree in each region. The table at the right provides the cumulative carbon sequestration and avoidance benefits in years five, fifteen, and forty, also by tree size and region. The chart in the bottom right corner provides the mean, median, and maximum values of carbon sequestered or avoided in years five, fifteen, and forty. This allows the user to see a best and worst case scenario if investments of the selected size are made in a single region, as well as the more realistic median scenario if funding is diversified across regions.</p>
