<h2>Quantifying And Monetizing Returns On Investments In Public Urban Forestry And Management Projects</h2>

<p>Trees planted in urban areas provide both carbon reduction and sequestration effects. Trees that shade buildings provide energy savings and reduce emissions from power plants. Trees are also natural carbon sequestration tools. Through photosynthesis, trees convert carbon dioxide into sugar and cellulose used for food and growth. Trees can store large amounts of carbon in their wood, and can store more carbon as they grow larger and mature.</p>
<p>In addition, urban forests provide green infrastructure, public health, and financial co-benefits for urban residents and municipal governments. Green infrastructure benefits include improved air quality, improved water and soil quality, and reduced storm water runoff. Public health benefits include decreased asthma and obesity, improved physical and mental health, protection from UV rays, and reduced noise pollution. Financial benefits include increased property values, increased sales in business districts, and reduced road maintenance costs.</p>
<p>Quantifying and monetizing carbon reduction and sequestration effects and the co-benefits of urban forestry and management projects across the state can be difficult. Tools like the U.S. Forest Service’s i-Tree suite exist for funders and implementers of urban forestry and management projects to do this kind of analysis on the project level. Most tools require the user to know how many trees will be planted, what kind, what size, and in which of California’s six climate regions, making them problematic for use in state-level decision-making about how much to invest in public urban forestry and management projects and where. In addition, they do not allow state-level actors to estimate returns on investment that can be used in cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost comparisons of urban trees to other carbon avoidance and sequestration investment options.

<h4>A tool for quantifying and monetizing the carbon effects and co-benefits of investments in urban forestry and management</h4>
<p>This tool provides users with 1). Estimates of annual cumulative tons of carbon sequestered or avoided and 2). Monetized estimates of the environmental and aesthetic net benefits after accounting for planting and maintenance costs for public trees planted in each of California’s six climate regions over a forty-year period. The tool allows the user to select a dollar level of investment, a social discount rate, and a carbon discount rate, and using information provided by the U.S. Forest Service, it then estimates the benefits of these investments. Results are provided by climate region and by size of tree. The tool is split into three dashboards; Dashboards 1 and 2 provide estimates of the cost-effectiveness of investments by quantifying the number of trees that can be planted and their carbon sequestration and avoidance effects per thousand dollars spent, and Dashboard 3 monetizes the carbon effects and co-benefits in a benefit-cost analysis.

<h4>Dashboard 1: Number of trees planted and carbon bang per buck</h4>
<p>This dashboard allows the user to input an investment value, a social discount rate, and a carbon discount rate in the cells highlighted yellow. All three dashboards refresh based on these three inputs. It then displays the number of small, medium, large, and conifer trees that can be planted in each region for the chosen level of investment and displays the carbon bang per buck, which is the metric tons of carbon sequestered or avoided per one thousand dollars spent over the forty-year period.
The investment value is how much the user will invest in urban forestry and management projects over the forty-year period. The social discount rate is used to calculate costs and benefits over the forty-year period rather than the interest rate to reflect that investments in urban trees represent investments in urban infrastructure. A social discount rate of 3.5% is typical in benefit-cost analyses like these. </p>
<p>Finally, the user must select a carbon discount rate. Discounting the carbon sequestration or avoidance effects of urban tree planting and maintenance assumes that carbon sequestration and avoidance today is worth more than carbon sequestration tomorrow. Discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% are typical in the U.S., but other models use rates as low as 0.1%. </p>

<h4>Dashboard 2: Carbon sequestered or avoided</h4>
<p>The figures in this dashboard display the cumulative metric tons of carbon sequestered or avoided over the forty-year period for each size tree in each region. The table at the right provides the cumulative carbon sequestration and avoidance benefits in years five, fifteen, and forty, also by tree size and region. The chart in the bottom right corner provides the mean, median, and maximum values of carbon sequestered or avoided in years five, fifteen, and forty. This allows the user to see a best and worst case scenario if investments of the selected size are made in a single region, as well as the more realistic median scenario if funding is diversified across regions.</p> 
<hr>
<h4>Dashboard 3: Net dollar benefits</h4>
<p>Dashboard 3 monetizes the carbon sequestration and avoidance effects as well as the co-benefits of urban forestry and management investments. Monetized benefits include: air conditioning and heating energy savings, atmospheric carbon dioxide reduction, air quality improvement, stormwater runoff reduction, increased property values, and increased aesthetics. 
The figures in this dashboard display the cumulative net benefits in dollars over the forty-year period for each size tree in each region. The chart on the right provides the cumulative net benefits in years five, fifteen, and forty, also by tree size and region. The chart in the bottom right corner provides the mean, median, and maximum values of net benefits in years five, fifteen, and forty. Like in dashboard 2, this allows the state to see a best and worst case scenario if investments of the selected size are made in a single region, as well as the likely median scenario if funding is diversified across regions. In addition, the figures allow the user to see in which years the cumulative benefits are larger than the cumulative costs, or where investments pass the benefit-cost test. </p>
