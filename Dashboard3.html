<h4>Dashboard 3: Net dollar benefits</h4>
<p>Dashboard 3 monetizes the carbon sequestration and avoidance effects as well as the co-benefits of urban forestry and management investments. Monetized benefits include: air conditioning and heating energy savings, atmospheric carbon dioxide reduction, air quality improvement, stormwater runoff reduction, increased property values, and increased aesthetics. 
The figures in this dashboard display the cumulative net benefits in dollars over the forty-year period for each size tree in each region. The chart on the right provides the cumulative net benefits in years five, fifteen, and forty, also by tree size and region. The chart in the bottom right corner provides the mean, median, and maximum values of net benefits in years five, fifteen, and forty. Like in dashboard 2, this allows the state to see a best and worst case scenario if investments of the selected size are made in a single region, as well as the likely median scenario if funding is diversified across regions. In addition, the figures allow the user to see in which years the cumulative benefits are larger than the cumulative costs, or where investments pass the benefit-cost test. </p>
